**Project Title: Airflix - ICAO Code Data Fetcher with React and useState**

**Description:**

"Airflix" is an engaging project that allows users to explore real-time information about airports using their International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) codes. The project focuses on demonstrating the integration of the `useState` hook in React to dynamically fetch and display airport data based on user input.

**Key Features:**

1. **ICAO Code Input:**
   - Users can input ICAO codes for specific airports.
   - Validate and handle user input to ensure accurate data retrieval.

2. **API Integration:**
   - Utilize a relevant aviation API that supports ICAO code queries.
   - Fetch and display information such as airport name, location, weather conditions, and other relevant details.

3. **React Components:**
   - Organize the application into modular components for enhanced maintainability.
   - Create dedicated components for input, data display, and error handling.

4. **State Management with `useState`:**
   - Leverage the `useState` hook to manage the state of ICAO codes and the fetched airport data.
   - Dynamically update the UI based on changes in the component state.

5. **User Interface:**
   - Design an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to interact with.
   - Display relevant airport information in a structured and user-friendly manner.

6. **Loading and Error Handling:**
   - Implement loading indicators during data retrieval to provide feedback to users.
   - Include error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage cases where API requests fail.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear documentation explaining how to use the application, input ICAO codes, and interpret the displayed data.
   - Document the structure of React components and the role of the `useState` hook in state management.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Gain hands-on experience in integrating an API with React to fetch dynamic data.
- Understand and implement the `useState` hook for effective state management.
- Learn to handle user input, perform data validation, and respond to API responses.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic understanding of React concepts (components, state, etc.).
- Familiarity with JavaScript and ES6 syntax.

**Technologies Used:**

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (or styled-components for styling)
- Aviation API supporting ICAO code queries

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Obtain an API key (if required) and configure it in the project.
4. Run the development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
5. Open the application in a web browser, input ICAO codes, and explore the real-time airport data.

**Conclusion:**

"Airflix" not only provides an interactive and educational experience for users interested in aviation but also serves as a practical demonstration of React and the `useState` hook in action. By following the project, developers can enhance their skills in API integration, state management, and building responsive React applications.
